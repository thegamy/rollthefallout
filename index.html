  <H1>ROLL OUT THE FALLOUT</H1>
  </p>What a time, oh, what a season
To be among the human race
We are conquering diseases
Sending teslas off to space

We won't set the world on fire
No big iron on my hip
I've stayed news-free for a while
Wonder what if something slipped

This just in: We have invented our own existential threats
  Ai works just like intended; soon we'll work for it instead
We learned nothing from that covid, next time we'll all just die out
If ice caps don't melt and flood us, we'll arrange our own fallout

The world wars have been forgotten; back to killing for some land
Back to juggling red buttons (it's okay with the un!)
We turn tyrants into heroes, cancel guiltness over thoughts
Summing up, the end is near. We're all doomed! Now, on to sports

I should be dreading
But strangely, I'm ready
My bottle cap fortune
Will rise in stock for real

So roll out the fallout
Come on, take us all out
I can't wait to sign up
With brotherhood of steel

(Is he talking to an imaginary character?)
(Yeah, it's kind of his thing)

  Just roll out the fallout
Go grab nuka cola
And call round my vault
I reside in 92

Death claws won’t surprise me
No worse than socializing
Yeah, war never changes
Good thing that we do

The world economy is falling
Faster than the price of caps
Karma system’s overhaul got
Cut out in a beta test

We’re obsessing over deadlines
We have 0 chance to hit
Can I get my vats already
So I could slow down a bit

Mods can’t fix the mess we made
Yeah, planet earth had quite a run

  Yeah, planet earth had quite a run
Now, it’s time for us to fade
Into oblivion with guns

So put on your power armor
Tighten firmly your pip-boys
Let’s go help out preston garvey
Like we really have a choice

Just roll out the fallout
Go grab nuka-cola
It’s glowing a bit
What can possibly go wrong

My bad days are over
With ghoulish makeover
I'm done moisturizing
My wrinkles are gone

Roll out the fallout
The curtain called out
To raging fog crawlers

  To tear this world apart

Just roll out the fallout
The front rows are sold out
We live in an open-world game

Roll out the fallout
Roll out the fallout

Just roll out the fallout
The front rows are sold out
We live in an open-world game
That was rigged from the start
